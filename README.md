## Introduction
Performer is an automatic full-stack web frame (or a web-generate tool), which can generate numerous form-style web pages with back-end code. The name of this project, performer, also means "per-form-er".

To use this web frame, you need edit a main configuration file (named "configuration.json") and serveral sub-configuration files (named "config_xx.json"). Then you can execute code_generator.py to generate the HTML, Javascript, and Python code.

By using this web frame, you can build many form-style web applications without writing any code.
